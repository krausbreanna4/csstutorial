In this tutorial I learned how to create anagylphic text using CCS. Anagylphic text is text that
looks like it has depth (3D Text), by overlaying one word over the other in opposite colors it adds depth to the text. I learned how to how to use RGBA colors and add opacity to text, use letter spacing, how to use the :after psuedo selector, and how to offset texts from one another.

    
	
	This article definitely fell short of expectations, it basically just showed the code and how create
the anagylphic text without walking the reader through it. It begins by explaining the :after psuedo selector and how it can be used, and then goes right into the code block. The article fails to explain what each CSS property is or what they do, luckily we've gone over most of them in class already, so I was able to figure most of it out. 

    
	
	The article was also a very basic version of the what they were trying to accomplish, they even say
at the end of it to add your own style the font and positioning. With some help from other articles and sites I was able to make the text and page look cleaner by using the RGBA coloring and opacity, changing the background color, center the div the text was in, and a font style and size.
